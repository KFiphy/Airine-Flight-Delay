# Airine-Flight-Delay


# Project Challenge:

Flight delay and cancellation action is inherently a problem across airlines, as canceled flights easily outnumber diverted ones in this dataset.
Using a flight dataset and Microsoft Power Bi, DAX formulas will be used to evaluate some metrics. Once these metrics have been completed, a report visualizing flight performance will be done. 


The tool used: Microsoft Power Bi 

# Techniques:

Data preparation

Data Modelling

Writing DAX formulas 

Data Analysis 

Data Visualization 

#  To deliver:

How the overall flight volume varies by month.

The day of the week with the highest flight volume.

Percentage of flights that experienced a departure delay in 2015.

The number of flights diverted in 2015.

The number of flights canceled in 2015. What % of cancellations were due to weather? What % were due to the Airline/Carrier?

The airline that seems to be the most reliable.

The 3 airlines which are the least reliable in terms of on-time departure?
